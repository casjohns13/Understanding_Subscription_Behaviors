They’ve collected data on client details, subscription records, and economic indicators and would like to connect them to better understand its clients’ behavior. \n\nThey’ve tasked you with analyzing these datasets to identify the key factors influencing clients’ decisions to renew their subscriptions. \n\nYour analysis will provide them with insights into which customers are renewing their products and the reasons behind their renewals. The company can leverage these insights to make informed decisions to increase renewal rates and improve customer loyalty, helping them stay competitive and ensure long-term growth.\n\n\n## The Data\n\nThe company have provided you with three datasets for your analysis. A summary of each data is provided below.\n\n## `client_details.csv`\n\n| Column         | Description|\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `client_id`    | Unique identifier for each client. |\n| `company_size` | Size of the company (Small, Medium, Large).|\n| `industry`     | Industry to which the client belongs (Fintech, Gaming, Crypto, AI, E-commerce).|\n| `location`     | Location of the client (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut).|\n\n## `subscription_records.csv`\n\n| Column             | Description   |\n|--------------------|---------------|\n| `client_id`        | Unique identifier for each client.|\n| `subscription_type`| Type of subscription (Yearly, Monthly).|\n| `start_date`       | Start date of the subscription - YYYY-MM-DD.|\n| `end_date`         | End date of the subscription - YYYY-MM-DD.|\n| `renewed`          | Indicates whether the subscription was renewed (True, False).|\n\n## `economic_indicators.csv`\n\n| Column           | Description                                       |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| `start_date`     | Start date of the economic indicator (Quarterly) - YYYY-MM-DD.|\n| `end_date`       | End date of the economic indicator (Quarterly) - YYYY-MM-DD.|\n| `inflation_rate` | Inflation rate in the period.|\n| `gdp_growth_rate`| Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate in the period.|\n","metadata":{},"id":"f98bdeaa-eac6-4f30-b47e-d45e4eab9cb2","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell\n# Import required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Import data\nclient_details = pd.read_csv('data/client_details.csv')\nsubscription_records = pd.read_csv('data/subscription_records.csv', parse_dates = ['start_date','end_date'])\neconomic_indicators = pd.read_csv('data/economic_indicators.csv', parse_dates = ['start_date','end_date'])","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":27,"lastExecutedAt":1752022975280,"lastExecutedByKernel":"575b009e-fded-4611-bbcc-afcff8a04731","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell\n# Import required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Import data\nclient_details = pd.read_csv('data/client_details.csv')\nsubscription_records = pd.read_csv('data/subscription_records.csv', parse_dates = ['start_date','end_date'])\neconomic_indicators = pd.read_csv('data/economic_indicators.csv', parse_dates = ['start_date','end_date'])","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":196,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"id":"73ca3720-210a-4230-8601-2ef53803a02f","cell_type":"code","execution_count":54,"outputs":[]},{"source":"## Getting Started\nFirst, I'm going to print the head of each of my datasets to get a better idea of the data I'm working with.

Store as a float variable called `average_inflation_for_renewals`.\nFirst, I created a new dataframe `inf_start_date` from the `economic_indicators` dataframe that contained only the start date for each inflation rate and the inflation rate. I did this to clean up my data as I know I will be merging this dataframe with an edited version of the `client_details_sub` dataset, and these are the only columns that I need. Next, I created a dataframe that only contains customers who renewed their subsriptions, which I called `client_det_renewed`. I then sorted `client_det_renewed` by renewal date (aka 'end_date' in the dataframe) to be able to merge it with my `inf_start_date` dataframe. Next, I used `pd.merge_asof()` to merge `client_det_renewed_sorted` with `inf_start_date` into another new dataframe, `client_renewed_inf`. I merged them on their 'end_date' and 'start_date' columns, respectively, using a backwards direction. I was able to do this because I know that in the `inf_start_date` dataframe, the inflation rate listed covers ever date from its entry date up until the next entry date. This means that for each 'end_date' in `client_det_renewed_sorted`, its corresponding inflation rate will be the inflation rate in `inf_start_date`who's corresponding 'start_date' is less than and closest to the 'end_date' in `client_det_renewed_sorted`.
