# Understanding Subscription Behaviors
A SaaS company seeks to uncover what drives its clients to renew their subscriptions. Combine and analyze the company's data to provide insights into its customer behavior and trends. You will use the datasets `client_details.csv`,  `subscription_records.csv`, and `economic_indicators.csv` to answer the following questions:
1. How many total Fintech and Crypto clients does the company have?
2. Which industry has the highest renewal rate?
3. For clients that renewed their subscriptions, what was the average inflation rate when their subscriptions were renewed?
